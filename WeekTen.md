* NB: This week is the FAC's mixture and interpretation of two methods - the Google Ventures design sprint and Design Thinking by IDEO (80s)

* It's design thinking week and Project One Week One - Design Sprint - having already [completed this in preparation for the project](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/preparation.md)

## Day One
_Resources:_ [_FAC design thinking basics PP_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1URTHmtKcxXUz2figOyczww41j8a1JhA5P18tpN-6CTU/edit#slide=id.g1d8ce2a6ed_0_13)

### Design Thinking Definitions

* **User Centered**: an iterative approach that engages users at every stage of the process and does not assume that we know exactly what our solution is going to look like. 
* **MVP**: “The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”— Eric Reis, The Lean Startup
    * It's the minimum version whilst the **prototype** is the quick mockup that can be static/not functional (e.g. images that can be linked together using [InvisionApp](https://www.invisionapp.com/))
* **User research vs User testing** - Research is what you do before starting work on the product.
Testing is what you do after the first version has been delivered (and you realise that you didn’t do your research properly) - and can be after the end of each sprint / throughout
* **AGILE**: It means working towards short-term and testable goals, which are reviewed at regular intervals in the light of user feedback. (For product management)
Because it is only by testing our ideas that we find out what we really need.
    * Iterative approach fromo **lean** - to build something testable at each stage: 
    ![The design thinking](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qINsG4WH_BDN-viMJUH6Ng.png)
    * The skateboard could have solved the problem of going from A to B - and the user could be happy with that rather than a car.
* **Product Owner**: The product owner is the person who ensures that the client gets the best from the development team - to ensure the vision is kept
    * They act as the buffer/person between the client/stackholders and the dev team (to manage the sprint and backlog)
    * From the agile methodology, a role within Scrum (product management)

* The stages:
    *  **Emphasise**  (conduct research to develop an understanding of your users/ building a connection with the people you're building for / reduce the amount of biases you have about who the users will be) > **Define** (Combine all your research and observe where your users problems exist / problem statement) > **Ideate** (Generate a range of crazy, creative ideas / solutions to the problem) > **Prototype** (Build real, tactile representations for a range of your ideas)> **Test** (Return to your users for feedback) > **Implement** (Put the vision into effect)
* **Design** refers to individuals, and making a products for them (a collab of eng and art) whilst **design thinking** are done by teams (**radical collaboration**) to produce experiences (user-centerred / UX approach) - in involve tech, biz and humans.
* Key phrases: **human centered**, **mindful of process**, **culture of prototyping** (each phase is a product like the car example - opposite is **waterfall** where everything is already defined), **show don't tell**, **radical collaboration**, **bias towards action**
* **Convirgent** mode of thinking - trying to decide on a solution etc VS **divergent** mode of thinking - i.e. brainstorming that focuses on quantity and withholds criticism

### Design Thinking Workshop
_Resources:_ [_the IDEO Design Thinking Workhop document_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/GiftGiving-Worksheets.pdf) _and_ [_crash course on design thinking_](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources-collections/a-virtual-crash-course-in-design-thinking)

* We completed [this IDEO Design Thinking Workhop document](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/GiftGiving-Worksheets.pdf) to improve our paired partner's gift giving experience. This is a quick run through of process in 2 hours.

#### The process
* **Empathy** (user research)
    * Interview - try to dig deeper at the emotions
* **Reframe** / **Define** the problem (retrospective on what found out)
    * Goals and wishes - what are they trying to achieve
    * Insights: new learnings about their feelings and motivations / what did you see about the experience that they didn't
    * From the above two, take a stand with a point-of-view/**personal statmenet** - [description of person] needs a way to [user's need] because (or 'but' / 'suprisingly') [insight - delve into emotions]
        * This is aimed to focus on what is most important, should be achievable and if told to a designer should inspire them to know what to design
* **Ideate**: generate alternative to test
    * Divergent - brainstorm as many radical ways to meet the users needs
    * Share solutions and capture feedback
    * Ideate based on feedback - reflect and generate a new solution (pick the best solution)
* Build the **prototype** - something the user can interact with
* **Test** the solution with the user
    * Feedback: what worked, what could be improved, questions and ideas

### Project - the design thinking phases

#### 1) Emphathise

_Resources:_ [_5 Step process for conducting user research - smashing mag_](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/5-step-process-conducting-user-research/) _and_ [_FAC workshop_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/research-learning-spiral.md)

* > Understanding is the key to problem solving. Without a solid grasp on what a problem is, where it originates, and what feeds it, any solution you arrive at will be inadequate. To gain this understanding, you’ll need to conduct user research.
* > User research helps designers and development teams gain insight into the lives of users, and their needs and wants. This lets them design and build tailored solutions, more effective than those lacking a solid research foundation.
    * > User research also helps us to avoid our own biases, because we frequently have to create design solutions for people who aren’t like us.

##### **Research Learning Spiral** (by [Frog Design](https://www.frogdesign.com/))

* The **Research Learning Spiral (RLS)** is a five-step process that will help you gather knowledge about your users and their needs.

1. **Objectives**
The Questions We Are Trying To Answer / Why You Are Conducting Research?
* Start by answering the “5W + H” (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How) questions:
    * **Who** am I designing for?  
    (This question helps you to determine prospective audiences for your design work, defining their demographics.)
    * **What** kinds of goals will those individuals be accomplishing as they use your product/service?  
    (Avoid [solutionising](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/submission/3306/solutionise) and think of the big picture)
    * **When** will those people be engaging with your product?  
    (This question helps you to determine the points in time when people might use particular products or technologies, as well as daily routines and rhythms of behaviour that might need to be explored.)
    * **Where** will those people be using what you are designing?  
    (This question helps you to determine contexts of use — physical locations where people perform certain tasks or use key technologies — as well as potential destinations on the Internet or devices that a user might want to access.)
    * **Why** are those people choosing to use what you’ve designed (and not something else) and what drives this behavior?  
    (This question helps you to explain the underlying emotional and rational drivers of what a person is doing, and the root reasons for that behaviour.)
    * **How** will they be using it?  
    (This question helps you go into detail on what explicit actions or steps people take in order to perform tasks or reach their goals.)
2. Hypotheses: What We Believe We Already Know
    * In a few bullet points- by building this app, what are you looking to prove?
3. Methods: How We Plan To Fill The Gaps In Our Knowledge. [More methods here](http://www.designkit.org/methods)
    * This step is dedicated towards choosing the best research methods to test your hypothesis and acquire the most validated learning. - 

4. Conduct: Gather Data Through The Methods We’ve Selected

A) Secondary research
_Resource:_ [_article_](http://www.designkit.org/methods/21)

    * Find out more about your design challenge
        * Once you know your design challenge, it’s time to start learning about its broader context. You can bone up quickly by exploring the most recent news in the field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, or journals to know what’s new.
        * Try to find recent innovations in your particular area. They could be technological, behavioral, or cultural. Understanding the edge of what’s possible will help you ask great questions.
        * Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of your own?
        * Because interviews can be highly qualitative, use your Secondary Research to get the facts and figures you need to understand the context of your challenge.

B) User persona
_Resource:_ [_user personas article from Mailchimp_](https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/) and [_more detailed article_](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/)

 * A representation of who you think your typical user is - as a means of reflecting on this research / having learnt a little about your target service user from the resaerch / based upon your findings and speculations so far. Use [this PDF](./creating-a-user-persona.pdf)
    * > Personas are representations of clusters of users with similar needs, goals, and behaviours. While a user persona is generally depicted as a single individual, this persona represents a group.
    * > Good personas help communicate and synthesise user research findings. They are realistic and paint a clear picture of a user’s goals, needs, and behaviours. They don’t need to be complicated or long. In fact, succinct, relaxed stories tend to be more effective.

- Descriptor - What type of persona is it - describe the most prominent differentiator
- Who is it - Who are they? Where are they from? / Personal profile, age, location, job title, kind of person (one more personas from segmentation)
- Quote - What are their goals and motivations? / Capture the essence to one or two points
- What are their frustrations? How are they feeling?
- What are their aspirations? (What is the supreme motivator / (latent) needs and desires)
- Things they like/dont like - what attitude - what is the point of view / expectation, perception of service, company or brand - what motivates to go to website/use service etc
- Which behaviour - what do they do, behvaiour using service etc, which channels used for various needs, what works well, what frustrations, stopping from choosing a service etc. // which trends/mindstyles indicators 
- Technology- apps and social networks they might use

* > When we do user-testing and surveying later in the week you will have the chance to verify and reflect on how accurate your hypothesis are. A user-persona isn’t a static creation you do once - it’s a dynamic representation of your own understanding that you return to and modify as it develops.

C) Surveying  / Interview
_Resources:_  [5 steps to creating good user interview questions](https://medium.com/interactive-mind/5-steps-to-create-good-user-interview-questions-by-metacole-a-comprehensive-guide-8a591b0e2162) _and_ [User interviews - the beginner's guide](http://theuxreview.co.uk/user-interviews-the-beginners-guide/)

* Each stage should lead to a deeper and more tailored understanding of your persona and their possible use of your app:

1. **Opening questions:** these are meant to ‘warm up’ your interviewee, so for example these could be general questions about his/her jobs, hobbies, habits, life choices ect.

2. **Deeper questions:** Go more into details, ask questions aimed at deeper motivations and needs. These could start to be tailored around the problems that your app is trying to solve.

3. **Specific questions about you app idea:** Questions which are specific to your app idea and how your user may or may not use it. (e.g - if, how, and why the app you are creating would be useful to them.)

Be sure to write down the details about your Persona. Create a profile which includes:

- Name
- Demographics (age, status, location, level of education, etc.)
- Current job title
- Any interests they are willing to share (maybe they play tennis?)

5. Synthesis
* Answer Our Research Questions, And Prove Or Disprove Our Hypotheses
* Write in a few bullets points what are possible insights you might have gained. Go back to your Hypothesis - could you say that it is still true? “From the interviews, I came across a few interesting findings….”

#### 2) Define
[FAC mini workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/define-exercises.md#point-of-view)

* Write **Problem Statement** based on findings
Re-cast the idea in human terms of what the technology allows your user to accomplish  // help you synthesise information to develop point of view statements and to generate potential ideas. // Using what you discovered in the Empathise stage, record the needs and insights of your group's user persona
    * THE USER needs a way to DO SOMETHING (THAT ADDRESSES THEIR NEED) so that SOMETHING HAPPENS (THAT BENEFITS THEM)

#### Define phase to Ideate phase
* **How Might We** based [from this kit](http://www.designkit.org/methods/3)
Turning problems into opportunities
1. Look at the “THEMES” and Sentences we created.
2. Put the letters “HMW” in the top left corner of your post it
3. Convert the sentences and themes into HMW questions, Write them on a sticky note
4. Peel off the note and stick to the wall
5. Read through them and bundle into themes:
    Identify themes and common patterns among the ideas
    Move the post its to group the post its with similar themes
    Make a record of themes you need to address
