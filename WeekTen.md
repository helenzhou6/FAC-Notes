* NB: This week is the FAC's mixture and interpretation of two methods - the Google Ventures design sprint and Design Thinking by IDEO (80s)

* It's design thinking week and Project One Week One - Design Sprint - having already [completed this in preparation for the project](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/preparation.md)

## Day One
_Resources:_ [_FAC design thinking basics PP_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1URTHmtKcxXUz2figOyczww41j8a1JhA5P18tpN-6CTU/edit#slide=id.g1d8ce2a6ed_0_13)

### Design Thinking Definitions

* **User Centered**: an iterative approach that engages users at every stage of the process and does not assume that we know exactly what our solution is going to look like. 
* **MVP**: “The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”— Eric Reis, The Lean Startup
    * It's the minimum version whilst the **prototype** is the quick mockup that can be static/not functional (e.g. images that can be linked together using [InvisionApp](https://www.invisionapp.com/))
* **User research vs User testing** - Research is what you do before starting work on the product.
Testing is what you do after the first version has been delivered (and you realise that you didn’t do your research properly) - and can be after the end of each sprint / throughout
* **AGILE**: It means working towards short-term and testable goals, which are reviewed at regular intervals in the light of user feedback. (For product management)
Because it is only by testing our ideas that we find out what we really need.
    * Iterative approach fromo **lean** - to build something testable at each stage: 
    ![The design thinking](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qINsG4WH_BDN-viMJUH6Ng.png)
    * The skateboard could have solved the problem of going from A to B - and the user could be happy with that rather than a car.
* **Product Owner**: The product owner is the person who ensures that the client gets the best from the development team - to ensure the vision is kept
    * They act as the buffer/person between the client/stackholders and the dev team (to manage the sprint and backlog)
    * From the agile methodology, a role within Scrum (product management)
* **User story** - Defines a single testable interaction. VS **User journey** - Describes all the interactions required to achieve a user goal. It is made up of several User stories. Who, what, wow - A to B with outcome. 
* **User centered design** - designing for the problem - narrowing it down to the most important goal to achieve as the first iteration of the app, and mindful of user stories.
* **UI** - wireframes: best possible portrayal of data (such as hierarchy) VS **UX**: beyond the app, data flow, what assume people know already & what do once have the app (writing it out as a conversation between the user and app)

* The stages:
    *  **Emphasise**  (conduct research to develop an understanding of your users/ building a connection with the people you're building for / reduce the amount of biases you have about who the users will be) > **Define** (Combine all your research and observe where your users problems exist / problem statement) > **Ideate** (Generate a range of crazy, creative ideas / solutions to the problem) > **Prototype** (Build real, tactile representations for a range of your ideas)> **Test** (Return to your users for feedback) > **Implement** (Put the vision into effect)
* **Design** refers to individuals, and making a products for them (a collab of eng and art) whilst **design thinking** are done by teams (**radical collaboration**) to produce experiences (user-centerred / UX approach) - in involve tech, biz and humans.
* Key phrases: **human centered**, **mindful of process**, **culture of prototyping** (each phase is a product like the car example - opposite is **waterfall** where everything is already defined), **show don't tell**, **radical collaboration**, **bias towards action**
* **Convirgent** mode of thinking - trying to decide on a solution etc VS **divergent** mode of thinking - i.e. brainstorming that focuses on quantity and withholds criticism

### Design Thinking Workshop
_Resources:_ [_the IDEO Design Thinking Workhop document_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/GiftGiving-Worksheets.pdf) _and_ [_crash course on design thinking_](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources-collections/a-virtual-crash-course-in-design-thinking)

* We completed [this IDEO Design Thinking Workhop document](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/GiftGiving-Worksheets.pdf) to improve our paired partner's gift giving experience. This is a quick run through of process in 2 hours.

#### The process
* **Empathy** (user research)
    * Interview - try to dig deeper at the emotions
* **Reframe** / **Define** the problem (retrospective on what found out)
    * Goals and wishes - what are they trying to achieve
    * Insights: new learnings about their feelings and motivations / what did you see about the experience that they didn't
    * From the above two, take a stand with a point-of-view/**personal statmenet** - [description of person] needs a way to [user's need] because (or 'but' / 'suprisingly') [insight - delve into emotions]
        * This is aimed to focus on what is most important, should be achievable and if told to a designer should inspire them to know what to design
* **Ideate**: generate alternative to test
    * Divergent - brainstorm as many radical ways to meet the users needs
    * Share solutions and capture feedback
    * Ideate based on feedback - reflect and generate a new solution (pick the best solution)
* Build the **prototype** - something the user can interact with
* **Test** the solution with the user
    * Feedback: what worked, what could be improved, questions and ideas

### Project - the design thinking phases

#### 1) Emphathise

_Resources:_ [_5 Step process for conducting user research - smashing mag_](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/5-step-process-conducting-user-research/) _and_ [_FAC workshop_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/research-learning-spiral.md)

* > Understanding is the key to problem solving. Without a solid grasp on what a problem is, where it originates, and what feeds it, any solution you arrive at will be inadequate. To gain this understanding, you’ll need to conduct user research.
* > User research helps designers and development teams gain insight into the lives of users, and their needs and wants. This lets them design and build tailored solutions, more effective than those lacking a solid research foundation.
    * > User research also helps us to avoid our own biases, because we frequently have to create design solutions for people who aren’t like us.

##### **Research Learning Spiral** (by [Frog Design](https://www.frogdesign.com/))

* The **Research Learning Spiral (RLS)** is a five-step process that will help you gather knowledge about your users and their needs.

1. **Objectives**
The Questions We Are Trying To Answer / Why You Are Conducting Research?
* Start by answering the “5W + H” (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How) questions:
    * **Who** am I designing for?  
    (This question helps you to determine prospective audiences for your design work, defining their demographics.)
    * **What** kinds of goals will those individuals be accomplishing as they use your product/service?  
    (Avoid [solutionising](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/submission/3306/solutionise) and think of the big picture)
    * **When** will those people be engaging with your product?  
    (This question helps you to determine the points in time when people might use particular products or technologies, as well as daily routines and rhythms of behaviour that might need to be explored.)
    * **Where** will those people be using what you are designing?  
    (This question helps you to determine contexts of use — physical locations where people perform certain tasks or use key technologies — as well as potential destinations on the Internet or devices that a user might want to access.)
    * **Why** are those people choosing to use what you’ve designed (and not something else) and what drives this behavior?  
    (This question helps you to explain the underlying emotional and rational drivers of what a person is doing, and the root reasons for that behaviour.)
    * **How** will they be using it?  
    (This question helps you go into detail on what explicit actions or steps people take in order to perform tasks or reach their goals.)
2. Hypotheses: What We Believe We Already Know
    * In a few bullet points- by building this app, what are you looking to prove?
3. Methods: How We Plan To Fill The Gaps In Our Knowledge. [More methods here](http://www.designkit.org/methods)
    * This step is dedicated towards choosing the best research methods to test your hypothesis and acquire the most validated learning.

4. Conduct: Gather Data Through The Methods We’ve Selected

A) Secondary research
_Resource:_ [_article_](http://www.designkit.org/methods/21)

    * Find out more about your design challenge
        * Once you know your design challenge, it’s time to start learning about its broader context. You can bone up quickly by exploring the most recent news in the field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, or journals to know what’s new.
        * Try to find recent innovations in your particular area. They could be technological, behavioral, or cultural. Understanding the edge of what’s possible will help you ask great questions.
        * Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of your own?
        * Because interviews can be highly qualitative, use your Secondary Research to get the facts and figures you need to understand the context of your challenge.

B) User persona
_Resource:_ [_user personas article from Mailchimp_](https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/) and [_more detailed article_](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/)

 * A representation of who you think your typical user is - as a means of reflecting on this research / having learnt a little about your target service user from the resaerch / based upon your findings and speculations so far. Use [this PDF](./creating-a-user-persona.pdf)
    * > Personas are representations of clusters of users with similar needs, goals, and behaviours. While a user persona is generally depicted as a single individual, this persona represents a group.
    * > Good personas help communicate and synthesise user research findings. They are realistic and paint a clear picture of a user’s goals, needs, and behaviours. They don’t need to be complicated or long. In fact, succinct, relaxed stories tend to be more effective.

- Descriptor - What type of persona is it - describe the most prominent differentiator
- Who is it - Who are they? Where are they from? / Personal profile, age, location, job title, kind of person (one more personas from segmentation)
- Quote - What are their goals and motivations? / Capture the essence to one or two points
- What are their frustrations? How are they feeling?
- What are their aspirations? (What is the supreme motivator / (latent) needs and desires)
- Things they like/dont like - what attitude - what is the point of view / expectation, perception of service, company or brand - what motivates to go to website/use service etc
- Which behaviour - what do they do, behvaiour using service etc, which channels used for various needs, what works well, what frustrations, stopping from choosing a service etc. // which trends/mindstyles indicators 
- Technology- apps and social networks they might use

* > When we do user-testing and surveying later in the week you will have the chance to verify and reflect on how accurate your hypothesis are. A user-persona isn’t a static creation you do once - it’s a dynamic representation of your own understanding that you return to and modify as it develops.

C) Surveying  / Interview
_Resources:_  [5 steps to creating good user interview questions](https://medium.com/interactive-mind/5-steps-to-create-good-user-interview-questions-by-metacole-a-comprehensive-guide-8a591b0e2162) _and_ [User interviews - the beginner's guide](http://theuxreview.co.uk/user-interviews-the-beginners-guide/)

* Each stage should lead to a deeper and more tailored understanding of your persona and their possible use of your app:

1. **Opening questions:** these are meant to ‘warm up’ your interviewee, so for example these could be general questions about his/her jobs, hobbies, habits, life choices ect.

2. **Deeper questions:** Go more into details, ask questions aimed at deeper motivations and needs. These could start to be tailored around the problems that your app is trying to solve.

3. **Specific questions about you app idea:** Questions which are specific to your app idea and how your user may or may not use it. (e.g - if, how, and why the app you are creating would be useful to them.)

Be sure to write down the details about your Persona. Create a profile which includes:

- Name
- Demographics (age, status, location, level of education, etc.)
- Current job title
- Any interests they are willing to share (maybe they play tennis?)

5. Synthesis
* Answer Our Research Questions, And Prove Or Disprove Our Hypotheses
* Write in a few bullets points what are possible insights you might have gained. Go back to your Hypothesis - could you say that it is still true? “From the interviews, I came across a few interesting findings….”

#### 2) Define
[FAC mini workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/design-sprint/define-exercises.md#point-of-view)

* Write **Problem Statement** based on findings
Re-cast the idea in human terms of what the technology allows your user to accomplish  // help you synthesise information to develop point of view statements and to generate potential ideas. // Using what you discovered in the Empathise stage, record the needs and insights of your group's user persona
    * THE USER needs a way to DO SOMETHING (THAT ADDRESSES THEIR NEED) so that SOMETHING HAPPENS (THAT BENEFITS THEM)

* **How Might We** (HMW) based [from this kit](http://www.designkit.org/methods/3)
Turning problems into opportunities
1. Look at the “THEMES” and Sentences we created.
2. Put the letters “HMW” in the top left corner of your post it
3. Convert the sentences and themes into HMW questions, Write them on a sticky note
4. Peel off the note and stick to the wall
5. Read through them and bundle into themes:
    Identify themes and common patterns among the ideas
    Move the post its to group the post its with similar themes
    Make a record of themes you need to address

* Pick to focus on one problem statement and HMW for the first iteration of the app.
    * > Trust your gut feeling: Choose those questions that feel exciting and help you think of ideas right away. 
    * > Select the questions that are most important to address and feel like they have the biggest opportunity for design solutions, even if they feel difficult to solve for.

* More research:
    * **Inspirational Overview** - what people do now/the services they use related to solving your problem
    * **Product/process audit** - why they use these services/ specific features that seem good

* Now narrowing it to find MVP (**BIG PICTURE GOAL**) / What are the user and organisational needs?
    * SPECIFIC **GOAL** - what do we want to achieve by solving this problem? / what is the big picture goal (start at the end) / describe the big picture goal
    * ONE **STAKEHOLDER** - WHO IS INVOLVED? - Who does it concern? not just users, but who shares the goal? / just one
    * PRODUCT / PROCESS AUDIT / **JOURNEY**- What are we already doing to achieve the goal? / a single outcome want to achieve
    * INSPIRATIONAL OVERVIEW - Who is achieving these goals in related fields? / a **tweet** advertising the service - the pitch

## Day Three

#### 3) Ideate

* Your idea as a message service: a script / dialogue between the site and user 

* Your idea as a mobile app: storyboard the transactions. Crazy 8s x2 -- each section will achieve the goal in a new inventive way (divergent mode of thinking).
    * Storyboard - an ordered set of screen designs for your user to explore / user journey (think about the different interactions the user will have) / (this is the visual version of the message service)

* Put storyboards up on wall and get everyone to talk through each one. This may well lead to a re-evaluation of the purpose of the app and the problem being solved. It is an opportunity to review the priority. 

#### 4) Prototype

##### Figma and Invision
_Resources:_ _Figma & Invision demos_ - [part 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B89QUJBPl5FKOUZlYWtyekZ0RFU/view?usp=sharing) & [part 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B89QUJBPl5FKX0lLbDBjSmZIQ3M/view?usp=sharing) _and_ [_design kit article_](http://www.designkit.org/methods/26)

* When exporting PNGs - 1x (pixels match the size), for retina screen blurry, 2x and 3x for higher resolution. 

## Day Four and five

#### 5) Test
_Resources:_ [_FAC user testing guide_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#1-planning) _and_ [_LCN user testing script_](https://github.com/InFact-coop/LCN/blob/master/UserTestingScript.md)

* Feedback: what did the user like / what did the user dislike / what new questions do we have /  what new ideas do we have

* The general layout of the test session should be like [this](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#4-test-session-x-3) - 5 min of set up, 10 min of tasks, 5 min for questions and wrap up
* The script: fleshed out version [here](https://github.com/InFact-coop/LCN/blob/master/UserTestingScript.md#script) and [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/weeks-10-12/user-testing.md#2-build-scriptguide), but basics are:
    * Start off saying
        * Very brief intro - the app should say what there is 
        * Tell them will not be offended by feedback - is there to help improve the app (not testing the user but the app)
        * Expect things to break - it is to test the flow
    * At end
        * What would you keep? What would you change?
        * Final thought

* General points:
    * Think about having some warm up questions to unease the user
    * Should not ask leading questions and prompt the user to have a continuous dialogue whilst testing - let them talk and ask why done certain behaviours
    * In pairs: one person looks at behaviour (can contradict what the person is saying and v important), and the other asks questions
    * Think about what functionality or endpoint ant user to test - and see where the user looks/clicks/any errors (take notes) - look at the [tasks they should complete here](https://github.com/InFact-coop/LCN/blob/master/UserTestingScript.md#tasks)
    * There is well known user habits and patterns that should not be disrupted (unless very good reason to)
    * Need to make sure the cognitive overload is low when using the application
    * > Pay particular attention to any strong emotional words, and any usage challenges/unexpected uses of the app (don’t show them how to use it, just watch what they do) - make sure you capture _*everything*_!
    * > Explore any issues they may raise
    * > Try not to speak unless asked something by participant (let them speak).
    * > If the participant
        > * asks you how to do something; _How do you think you should do it?_.
        > * stops speaking for a while; _Please remember to speak your thoughts aloud_.
        > * makes a comment & you're not sure what triggered it; _Was there something in particular that made you think that?_.
        > * wanders away from the task; _What are you trying to do now?_.

* Create an issue in the repo saying **User Testing: (DD-MM-YYYY)**, as the description write the *observers template* (that will be filled in and pasted into a comment during testing session):
    - Users name.
    - Users top three pain points using application.
    - Users profile.  
    - Additional observations section.

* > Debrief: Explore common user feedback and agree on most prominent issues (2-3) to address first, then discuss how to address issues.

### Design talks
_Resource:_ _external talk from designers are Outlandish_

Design process involves:
1. Concept and scope - make vision into tangible product
2. Design and Validate
3. Execute and Validate
4. Build and Manage - handover

* Use black and white basic design for UX design (so that the design is not focused on), then UI design after this

_Resource:_ _external talk from an alumni FAC member (now working as a UX and service manager)_
* **Hypothesis** - broader than a problem statement. Don't make assumptions
    * Believe that people have [a problem], and assume have [an app] - both need to be aligned
    * The gamble is that the PO understands the nature of their problems, and forces them to learn [the app] since they believe it will benefit them 
* **Service** - let people use it but they do not own it 
* **Service Design** - When fully realised, the full user journey is plotted out from hearing about the app to leaving, and split into front stage and back stage.
* **Innovation** - calculated risks, limit yourself with data
    * E.g. Apple have popular apps listed in the App Store whilst the user research approach may have lead to a file structure with hierarchy (like the default folder structure on your computer)
    * VS **Optimisation** routes e.g. manipulinks and dont-leave-me-modals
* **data-driven design** - will design better vs design for something new
* Google time well spent: apps that don't take up all your time (not use as currency to measure how well app is doing)
