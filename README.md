# FAC

I (somehow) made it to FAC13 ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰, and these are just notes based on the materials covered. Hopefully I'll keep this up.

*   [Pre course notes](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/precourse.markdown) - (mostly based on the [pre course FAC materials](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/precourse))
*   [Week One](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekOne.md) - Accessibility week. Project: making [a simple Portfolio One Pager](https://github.com/fac-13/plhh)
*   [Week Two](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekTwo.md) - Testing using [NPM Tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape). Project: [To do app](https://github.com/fac-13/PLHH-ToDo) using TDD.
*   [Week Three](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekThree.md) - API requests. Project: website using 2 external APIs ([mixtape generator](https://github.com/fac-13/vith-Mixtape)) made from the front end (using XHR requests)
*   [Week Four](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekFour.md) - Node week. Project: [website with autocomplete](https://github.com/fac-13/vithAutocomplete) - XHR request from the front end to a JSON data file in the backend server (that we set up)
*   [Week Five](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekFive.md) - Node week two. Project: [website](https://github.com/fac-13/jeth) with an XHR request from the front end to back end, and then the back end server makes an API call.
*   [Week Six](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekSix.md) - Databases. Project: [a dynamic web app](https://github.com/fac-13/HEII-topics) which uses data from a database (connected to via a node.js server).
