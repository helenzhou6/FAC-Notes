# FAC
I (somehow) made it to FAC13 ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰, and these are just notes based on the materials covered. Hopefully I'll keep this up.
- [Pre course notes](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/precourse.markdown) - (mostly based on the [pre course FAC materials](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/precourse))
- [Week One](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekOne.md) - Accessibility week. Project on making a simple Portfolio One Pager
- [Week Two](https://github.com/helenzhou6/FAC-Notes/blob/master/weekTwo.md) - Testing using [NPM Tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape).
