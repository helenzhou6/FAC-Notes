_Resource:_ [_week one schedule_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/week-1).
## Day One
### Paired programming
_Resource:_ [_paired programming_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-1/pair-programming.md).
* We ended up trying to solve a simple kata that should of involved using the [```slice()``` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice). Instead we ended up going down a regex rabbit hole - but discovered that regex looks at each character, sees if it matches the argument, then repeats this process for each character until the end of the string.

### Accessibility
_Resource:_ [_accessibility exercise_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/web-accessibility/blob/master/putting-yourself-in-someone-elses-shoes.md) and [_extra resources_](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/web-accessibility/blob/master/tools-that-can-help.md).
* Use this [HTML5 Outliner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo?hl=en) tool to check your HTML makes semantic sense. The section titles are obtained by your ```h1``` (if your nav doesn't have one - put an ```heading``` tag but then hide it.)
* See what accessibility issues your site has by putting it through [this validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). (We thought this gave more in-depth answers than the Chrome Dev Tools Audit).

### Github Scavenger Hunt
